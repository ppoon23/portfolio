My old coworker invited me to visit the xAI campus. It was a great experience to see how the company is doing. 

When I first arrived, the security guard asked for my ID and QR code. I had already registered prior to the visit, but it did not work somehow. 

After walking in I met up with the old coworker. The pizza event was hosted outside at the patio area. They had a pizza oven and in-house chefs were making pizzas while we were there.

We chatted for a while. I thought it was a little bit but it turned out to be close to 3 hours. It seemed like the company is growing fast by the number of employees. roughly 20 engineers every week.

Who knows if they are hiring more engineers now and laying off in the future. I guess time will tell.
